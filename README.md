# Hi, I'm Prithvi 👋
I am a Software Developer. I also [write](https://prithvi-rajan.vercel.app) a bit.

# My projects
## Slide-CN
[Slide-CN](https://slide-cn.com) is a React based UI library that allows people to create slide decks using code. I want to treat slides like UI, unlocking benefits like:
- git version control
- Reusable Components
- Real time data in slides
- Interactive slides
- Hosting slides as a website, and sharing it using a link
- MCP support to build presentations easily using LLMs
### Tech Stack
- React / Next.js
- TailwindCSS

## [Nocten.ai](https://nocten.ai)
A tool for product managers, that analyzes user questions, and provides insights about your product. It helps PMs understand the following:
- Where users face friction in your product
- What are the constraints and requirements of potential users
- What users expect from your product, and what they compare your product with
### Tech used
I build Nocten using Django + Celery + Redis + Postgres + Milvus for the backend, and React + Typescript + Shadcn for the frontend. I am documenting the technical challenges I faced in my [personal blog](https://prithvi-rajan.vercel.app)
